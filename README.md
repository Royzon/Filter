# Filter
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kyawawa/Filter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kyawawa/Filter)

This is a c++14 library for state estimation filtering such as Kalman Filter.

Currently these filters are implemented:
- Linear Kalman Filter
- Extended Kalman Filter

And these utils are implemented:
- Discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation (Arimoto-Potter method)
- Multivariate normal distribution generator
